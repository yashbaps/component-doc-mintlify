## Component Breakdown

### 1. **Theming (Look & Feel)**

- Controls **visual style** (colors, fonts, spacing, animations).
- Must be **cross-application adaptable** (global theme tokens, theme provider).
- Should not affect behavior or logic.
- Examples:
  - Button → size, color scheme, border-radius, hover effect.
  - Notification → placement, background, animation style.

---

### 2. **Layout (Structure & Composition)**

- Defines **how sub-parts are arranged**, without changing the internal business rules.
- Should be **overridable via builders/properties/configuration**, not by rewriting component internals.
- Examples:
  - Card → header, body.
  - CMS Page → sidebar, content area, toolbar.
  - Modal → header placement, close button position.

---

### 3. **Internal Business Logic (BL)**

- Encapsulates **state management & functional behavior**.
- Should be **implicit by default** (component manages its own state) but **exposable for control**.
- Must be **type-safe** → compile-time errors for missing logic.
- Examples:
  - Dropdown → open/close state, keyboard navigation.
  - File Picker → file validation, upload queue, error handling.
  - Cache Manager → data persistence, eviction policies.
